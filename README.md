# matrix_factorization
The Gauss-Jordan algorithm is a variation of Gaussian elimination. The two features that distinguish the Gauss-Jordan method from standard Gaussian elimination are:
- Each pivot element is forced to be 1,
- The elements below and above the pivot are eliminated.

Then, we develop a program that solves a n x n system using `R`.

The LU file computes the LU factorization. The PA_LU computes the PA=LU decomposition.
